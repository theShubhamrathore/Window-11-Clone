CSS
The CSS files control the styling of the application. They are responsible for controlling the layout, colors, and other visual elements of the interface.

JavaScript
The JavaScript files control the functionality of the application. They are responsible for making the elements in the interface interactive and for implementing features such as the to-do list and excel sheet.
